#### Description:

This is a web application. It allows user to upload and store photos of an obstacles in your city. You can review them any time you want.
All you need is to register and login. After that on main page click the button "Add photo". Choose the right photo on your device and name it
with the exact address. Click add and the photo will appear on the page. If the page was refreshed, the photos won't disappear.

### Files

This application contains python files, html files, css file and database file. Main functionality was achieved in app.py file.
I was debating in using JavaScript or Python for adding photos function. But after many trying and fails I switched to python.
