### Motivation:

Many people are struggling moving through the city. Elderly people, ones who have mobility disability and even parents with baby stroller. They all face obstacles on our streets. But we can make a good impact on that. Lviv (your city) is a very beautiful city. Its architecture admires us. But there is always something that can be improved. High borders, absence of ramps and other obstacles makes living for low mobility people really hard. This site was made to help solve these problems.

### Files:

This application contains python files, html files, css file and database file. Main functionality was achieved in app.py file.
I was debating in using JavaScript or Python for adding photos function. But after many tries and fails I switched to python. 
As it appears it was a right decision. I think the main reason was that we spent much more time working with Python than with JavaScript.

### Personal:

For me as a father of a newborn baby this problem appears almost every day. When I go for a walk with my child in a baby stroller I find it hard to move through the city. High borders and stairs without ramps makes lots of difficulties. Also moving in a public transport might be hard. Need to ask people for assistance. In the future I hope to connect this site to a city administration, so these problems could be solved much quicker.
